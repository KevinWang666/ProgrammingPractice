Peter 
I 
know 
things have been difficult 
lately 
and 
I am 
sorry 
about 
that 
I 
thing I 
know what you 
are feeling Ever 
since you 
were a 
little 
boy 
You 
have been 
living 
with so many unresolved 
things Well 
take it 
from 
an 
old 
man Those things 
send us down the road And 
make 
us who we 
are And 
if 
anyone¡¯s 
destined 
for greatness 
it¡¯s 
you 
my son 
You 
owe 
the 
world 
your gifts you 
just 
have 
to 
figure 
out 
how 
to 
use 
them And 
know 
that wherever they 
take you we¡¯ll 
always 
be here So come 
home peter 
You 
are my 
hero 
and 
I love 
you
