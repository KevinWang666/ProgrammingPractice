It¡¯s
easy
to
feel
hopeful
on
a
beautiful
day
like
today
But
there
will
be
dark
days
ahead
of
us
too
There
will
be
days
where
you
feel
all
alone
And
that¡¯s
when
hope
is
needed
most
No
matter
how
buried
it
gets
or
how
lost
you
feel
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
hold
on
to
hope
Keep
it
alive
We
have
to
be
greater
than
what
we
suffer
My
wish
for
you
is
to
become
hope
People
need
that
And
even
if
we
fail
what
better
way
is
there
to
live?
As
we
look
around
here
today
at
all
of
the
people
who
helped
make
us
who
we
are
I
know
it
feels
like
we¡¯re
saying
goodbye
But
we
will
carry
a
piece
of
each
other
into
everything
that
we
do
next
To
remind
us
of
who
we
are
and
who
we
are
meant
to
be
I¡¯ve
had
a
great
four
years
with
you
and
I
will
miss
you
all
very
much
